80,000 Hours
============
This is the Ruby on Rails application which runs the
http://www.80000hours.org/ website.

80,000 Hours is an organisation which encourages and supports people who
are pursuing careers which they believe will do the *most good*.  When most
people think of ethical careers, they think of charity work, or similar. We
believe that earning a large salary and donating a significant fraction to the
most effective charities you can do a lot more good than you could do as a
doctor working in the developing world. Other possibilities include becoming a
high impact influencer, or doing high impact research.
