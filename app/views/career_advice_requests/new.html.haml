  %h1 Career advice session
  %p 
    In an advice session, you’ll have a chance to talk to a member of the 80k
    Careers Research team. The session will start with the advisor aiming to
    understand your situation, after which they will suggest how to apply
    <a href="/career-research">our research</a> to your choices. They may also
    be able to introduce you to people with similar interests in the
    community or do follow up work.
    
  %p 
    Please glance at the <a href="/career-advice">basic ideas</a> behind our
    approach and <a href="/how-are-we-different">how our advice is
    different</a> before attending the session.
    
  %p 
    Please also note that our advice service is currently in a trial phase.
    One thing this means is that we sometimes run out of capacity, and we won’t
    always be able to give you a session.
