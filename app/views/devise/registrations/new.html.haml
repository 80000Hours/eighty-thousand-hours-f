  %h1 Sign up for an 80,000 Hours account

%p There are two ways to create an 80,000 Hours account

.row
  .span6
    .alert.alert-info
      %h1.alert-heading External provider
      The easiest way to create an account is by linking to an external provider such as Facebook. You can do this by clicking the appropriate button.

  .span6
    .alert.alert-info
      %h1.alert-heading Email and password
      If you don't have an account with an external provider, or you just want to login to 80,000 Hours with a username and password, then you can fill in the form.

.row
  .span6
    = render partial: 'authentications/options'

  .span6
    = simple_form_for(resource, :as => resource_name, :url => registration_path(resource_name), :html => { :class => "form-horizontal" }) do |f|
      = f.error_notification
      .form-inputs
        = f.input :name,      :required => true, :autofocus => true, :hint => 'This will be displayed publicly. Can be a pseudonym.'
        = f.input :real_name, :hint => 'Never displayed publicly.'
        = f.input :email,     :required => true
        = f.input :password, :required => true
        = f.input :password_confirmation, :required => true
      .form-actions
        = f.button :submit, "Sign up"

.box
  %hr
  = render "links"
