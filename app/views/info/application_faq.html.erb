  The <%= org_name %> pledge is designed so that you can spend the early years of
  your career building up your capacity to do good later. For example, a young
  person getting started in politics or campaigning won't have much influence at
  first, but will be able to do a lot of good over their whole career. Similarly,
  if you started a company, you wouldn't be able to give much money at first, but
  you'd be able to give 10% of your lifetime income once you'd got your company
  established.

  At least 10% of your time at work, so that would be 4 hours of a 40 hour
  week. This lets people who want to engage in some high impact activities, but
  canâ€™t spend all of their career in that way, make a contribution. For
  instance, a scientist could spend some of their time researching high impact
  causes. Or, someone pursuing any career could spend some of their time
  inspiring others or volunteering for us.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Anyone who devotes their entire career to helping others counts as donating
  100% of their time.
