      Weâ€™ve been raising some controversy in the media by suggesting that
      becoming a philanthropic banker could help more people than many
      conventional ethical careers.

      Does this mean that professional philanthropy is the career that does the most
      good? Does this mean that you should pursue professional philanthropy? No!
      There are many high impact activities that do far more good than professional
      philanthropy. Your individual skills are also very important.
