  Paul Ehrlich began his 1968 book, The Population Bomb, with this statement: 

    The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to
    death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a
    substantial increase in the world death rate.

  Ehrlich predicted the deaths as a consequence of the challenge of feeding a rapidly growing world
  population, pointing to recent devastating famines in South Asia. But even as those words were 
  written, the fields were being planted with new, higher-yielding semi-dwarf strains of wheat and rice.
  Combined with modern fertilizers and other methods, these strains ushered in the [“Green Revolution”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_revolution):
  wheat production in India and Pakistan almost doubled between 1965 and 1970, and formerly 
  famine-wracked countries became self-sufficient in food and have not seen such hunger since.  The 
  agronomist Norman Borlaug, who developed new and more effective methods of plant breeding, used them 
  to develop the key strain of wheat, and brought about expansion of his methods to other crops and 
  deployment in South Asia, played a pivotal role. Some [credit him](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/6101/) with saving a billion lives, 
  referring to the number of people fed by the increase agricultural production of the Green Revolution.
  Indisputably, scientific and technological advances and technological innovation have brought about 
  almost incredible amounts of good.  

  ##Not whether, but when?

  However, when we ask how we can effectively do good in our careers, the key question is not how much 
  scientific research on the whole has made the world better: it is “how do I expect the world to be 
  different if I take up this career, rather than another one?” If Norman Borlaug had never lived his 
  discoveries would eventually have been made by others.  Continued food scarcity would have evoked both
  market and government responses in increased research.  Fertilizers and other agricultural technologies
  would have been applied without enhanced crop varieties, capturing some of the Green Revolution’s
  benefits.  We should think of achievements like Borlaug’s as bringing about technologies faster, rather
  than making them possible at all.

  However, tremendous impacts are possible through speeding the pace of progress, even slightly.  
  According to the [WHO](http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/malaria2010_summary_keypoints_en.pdf), malaria killed over 781,000 people in 2009. If current trends continue, advances
  in vaccines, bednets, mosquito control, and increased deployment efforts will likely eventually drive 
  down fatalities to zero.  But leaping ahead in this process by a single year could save 781,000 lives. 
  A single day’s speedup would save 2,139 lives.  Advancing the process by even 40 seconds would save a
  life.  Then the question becomes: how many seconds can you expect to advance your field over your 
  career?

  Norman Borlaug advanced progress on a massive issue by years, a truly exceptional achievement that very
  likely saved millions of lives or more over time.  But far more scientists, working on important but 
  neglected problems, could each hope to do good comparable to moving malaria eradication forward several
  days.  Such an achievement could do as much good as donating millions of pounds to apply existing 
  vaccines or drugs. 

  ##How much can I advance my field?

  When we consider donating to administer treatments for tuberculosis or malaria, we can measure lives
  saved through randomized experiment: administer the treatment to half of a study population at random,
  and see how many more members of the vaccinated group remain healthy.  Estimating the impact of 
  individual research contributions is harder.

  It’s easy to measure inputs such as R&D funding and scientific workforce.  For instance, [spending on 
  malaria R&D](http://www.malariavaccine.org/files/RD-report-June2011.pdf) was $612 million in 2009, after doubling from 2004 levels thanks to increased spending by
  the Gates Foundation and United States NIAID.  So one can fairly easily find out whether adding one’s
  brain or donations to the field will boost the relevant inputs by 10% or by 0.01%, and rephrase 
  questions about impact of additional researchers in terms of the speed increase from a percentage 
  resource increase.  Will doubling R&D budgets cut development time by at least 10%? 2%? 0.2%? Phrased
  in this way, it is easier to draw on other knowledge to judge the plausibility of potential impacts.

  When a [panel](http://www.rethinkhiv.com/priorities/113-georgetown-university-expert-panel) convened by the [RethinkHIV](http://www.rethinkhiv.com/priorities) initiative, which performed cost-benefit analysis of a number
  of HIV/AIDS interventions, [turned to HIV vaccine research](http://www.rethinkhiv.com/images/Papers/111118141329-ccc93b191d114d1fb9b1dd3cc7c49e5e.pdf), it consulted expert HIV researchers to 
  estimate a likelihood that vaccine development would be both successful and not preempted by
  substitutes. The cost of vaccine development was estimated based on the costs and frequency of past 
  partially successful vaccine candidates. They then found very large benefits relative to costs from
  increasing annual R&D spending from $900 million to $1 billion, provided that this increase would 
  accelerate vaccine development by ~5 months (vs a baseline 20-30 year timeframe), so that vaccine 
  research would outrank deployment of existing treatments in cost-effectiveness.

  Reasoning like this, taking into account the magnitude of potential gains in a field, the scale of 
  inputs so far, track records in similar fields, expert judgment (with [caveats](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7959.html)) and interim successes,
  can make a good start at deciding what research areas to bet on when trying to steer towards high 
  impact.
