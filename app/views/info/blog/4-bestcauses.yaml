  If you’re reading this, I’ll assume you’re convinced by the philosophy of
  80,000 Hours - so you won’t find an argument for that philosophy here. This
  post is just to help you decide where to best give your money right now, if
  that’s what you’ve decided to do. 
  
  Plenty of organisations want your money, but a select few really stand out.
  So what is the best option?
  
  Honestly, we don’t know yet. Thanks to [GiveWell](http://givewell.org/charities/top-charities) and [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/),
  efficient philanthropy has become much easier in the last couple of years,
  but they might still find better causes. Their recommendations overlap, but
  are far from equivalent, partly because of the different values they espouse.
  However, their work has already been so useful that using it to give now is
  literally thousands of times better than using the best evaluators was only a
  few years ago, which focused only on admin costs and ignored what the
  charities were actually trying to achieve.
  
  So below is a list of groups you might consider supporting, in no particular
  order, why they’re a top candidate, and at the end some considerations to
  help you decide between them. I’ve kept the summaries brief and linked to
  more information at the bottom.
  
  ##[Deworm the World](http://www.dewormtheworld.org/) and [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/) (SCI) 
  
  These are together because they’re so similar. Both focus exclusively on
  curing people of parasitic worms that cause horrific deformities (Google
  ‘Schistosomiasis’ in an image search for some examples - I won’t subject you
  to them here); both are in the top tier of Giving What We Can’s
  recommendations; and both have violently unsexy names - perhaps the reason
  why they’re so underfunded.
  
  ###Why SCI/Deworm the World?
    * Strictly in terms of cost for the health
      intervention they provide, these two are unmatched. Buying a year of life
      at full health from them costs US$2.14 (GWWC’s estimate). For comparison,
      the NHS consider any intervention that buys that healthy year for $20,000
      worthwhile.
    * Besides their health benefits, these charities turn out to be a great
      boon for education:  because the symptoms of Schistosomiasis cause so much
      time missed from school, for every $3.60 you donate, you’ll be effectively
      buying an [extra year of schooling](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/primary-school-deworming-kenya?pid=21) for would’ve-been sufferers.
  
  
   
  ##[VillageReach](http://villagereach.org/)
  
  This group’s main goal is to improve the medical-supply delivery systems in
  hard-to-reach rural areas in developing countries.
  
  
  ###Why VillageReach?
    * VillageReach is in the top tier of GiveWell’s recommended
      charities, partly because of the effectiveness of their interventions and
      partly because of their outstanding transparency, which allows for more
      reliable evidence of their effectiveness.

    * The magic number: according to GiveWell’s estimates, it costs
      VillageReach $400-800 to save a life. This is a different metric from the
      one used by Giving What We Can; I’ll compare them at the end.
  
  ##[Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/)
  I know, the V-word. Stop backing away - it’s not (quite) what you think. VO’s
  mission is to persuade people to become vegan by being a good example of
  friendly vegans. They print and distribute leaflets that appeal to calm reason (and
  yes, emotion) to convince people to switch to a vegan lifestyle in the US,
  where farming laws are lax enough that meat eating is arguably more harmful
  than anywhere else.
  
  
  ###Why Vegan Outreach?
    * If you believe that animals’ suffering is similar in kind to humans’,
    even if not in degree, and if you take VO’s data about their success rate
    at face value, then this is a clear winner. According to Alan Dawrst’s
    [summary of their claims](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf) (PDF. See section 5), $1 prevents between 100 days
    and 51 years of factory farm suffering.

    * Because of the huge impact of the livestock industry on climate change,
    this is currently the closest thing to an environmental charity on the
    recommendations list. Though the degree of difference is controversial,
    more vegans means [lower carbon emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock's_Long_Shadow).

    * Similarly, though independently, reducing our meat consumption also means
    we use [less freshwater](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2008/08/the-truth-about-saving-water/).
  
  
  ##[Stop TB Partnership](http://www.stoptb.org/)
  
  No surprises here. This group approaches the TB problem from all angles -
  raising awareness, prevention, medicine, and further research. 
  
  ###Why Stop TB Partnership?
 
    * They’re number two in both GiveWell and Giving What We Can’s rankings. Even if you favor one group’s methodology over the other’s, the joint support should surely raise your confidence.

    * Both groups estimate them at about the same impact - roughly $22.40
    (GWWC) or $5-50 (GiveWell) per year of life at full health.

    * Self-interest. Let’s be honest - If you’re reading this, you’ll never
    suffer from Schistosomiasis, or find yourself the wrong side of a factory
    farm. Your chances of getting TB are also slim - but [significantly higher](http://priory.com/cmol/tbanga.htm)
    (see the conclusion). In an ideal world self-interest wouldn’t affect your
    donations, but we’re all human, and if you need just a little extra
    motivation to give, this could be it.
  
  
  
  ##Diversification
  One further possibility remains. I’ve been talking about ‘the best’ cause,
  but could all of these groups be worth giving a fraction of your donation to? 
  
  I think this is the wrong approach. Steven Landsburg has already argued this,
  so I’ll simply point to his essay [‘Giving Your All’](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/1997/01/giving_your_all.html).
 
  ##Final Considerations
  
  Hopefully, the recommendations of different groups will align more over
  time, and then it will be obvious which cause to give to, at least until
  they’re so successful they don’t need your money as much.
  
  Meanwhile, choosing between these options will likely depend on your values.
  Some key considerations:
  
    * GiveWell and Giving What We Can employ different research methodologies,
    so they reach different conclusions. Perhaps the main difference between
    the groups in that GiveWell rate transparency as a plus in itself, whereas
    GWWC are interested in it only in that it makes for higher uncertainty.
    Presumably Elie and Holden (the GiveWell founders) wouldn’t say that
    transparency is an ultimate virtue, but they’ve pointed out that their
    focus encourages greater honesty in the long run. You can see extensive
    (but unfinished) discussions between the two groups in the comments
    following [these threads](http://blog.givewell.org/2010/03/19/cost-effectiveness-estimates-inside-the-sausage-factory/).
  
  
    * The GiveWell founders Elie and Holden have both said they consider animal
    welfare [relatively unimportant](http://blog.givewell.org/2010/12/27/animal-welfare-charities/), whereas Giving What We Can have focused their research on
    health intervention so far, so while Alan Dawrst is a solo researcher, the bigger
    groups’ failure to endorse Vegan Outreach might not tell us much.

    * While the effects of parasitic worms are deeply unpleasant, they’re
    seldom fatal. GWWC have taken this into account in their estimates, but it
    means that while the other interventions actually save people’s lives, SCI
    and DtW ‘only’ tend to improve them. If that makes SCI and DtW seems worse
    in your view, ask yourself whether you’d prefer to save someone from death
    or from lifelong torture. No one is claiming the answer is obvious...
  
    * The causes here are only the ones whose results have been fairly well
    examined - which means they’re biased towards groups whose goals are easily
    measurable. Plenty of other causes are potentially as important or more,
    from the familiar (political campaigning, medical research), to the more
    controversial (research into [human extinction](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/ ), developing genuine
    [artificial intelligence](http://singinst.org/)). We’ll look at these more in future posts.
                  
  That’s it from me. Tell me if I’ve missed anything, and I’ll try and keep
  this post up to date.
  
  It’s up to you from here...
