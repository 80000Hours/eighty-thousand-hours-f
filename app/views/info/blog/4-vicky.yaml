  Want to make a difference? Want to make the most different that you can?
  Become a banker. An ethical banker.
  
  Not what you expected? Research on professional philanthropy by an Oxford
  University ethicist today reveals a new way of looking at ethical careers.
  Believe it or not, it is possible to be an ethical banker. William Crouch
  today discusses his research at the Uehiro Centre in Oxford University's
  Philosophy Faculty with Ian Hislop on the Today Programme at 8:45am.
  
  Crouch is launching 80,000 Hours: an organisation which is redefining
  ethical careers. Incredibly an individual typically spends 80,000 hours on
  their career: choosing a career which maximises the difference you can make
  is therefore paramount for those considering an ethical career.
  
  Professional philanthropy - deliberately pursuing a lucrative career in order
  to donate a substantial proportion of earnings to the best causes - may have
  significantly more impact than careers traditionally considered as ethical.
  Let us take the example of a banker and a charity worker: firstly consider
  the financial discrepancy in earnings – the money that a banker donates can
  pay for several charity workers who would be better qualified to do the job.
  
  Secondly, money is fungible and can be moved to come along whereas experience
  as a charity often non-transferable. Thirdly, the charity a similar charity
  worker but the ethical banker banker who would probably keep all his money to
  the ethical banker would make a difference which occurred without his
  choosing professional
  
  These factors mean that the “direct benefit a single aid worker can produce
  is limited, whereas the philanthropic banker's donations might indirectly
  help ten times as many people.”
  
  Ian Hislop’s programme When Bankers Were Good is aired tonight on BBC 2 at
  9pm and looks at the philanthropic pursuits of Victorian bankers. In an
  interview with the Telegraph Hislop comments: “People were greedy then but
  there was at least a culture of religious or humanist figures at the heart of
  banking who thought they should be doing things better that seems to be a
  model which we don’t now have.”
  
  Tune into William Crouch’s and Ian Hislop’s discussion on the Today Programme
  at 8:45am to hear more about why spending your 80,000 hours conducting
  professional philanthropy is ethical preferable to traditional ethical
  careers.
