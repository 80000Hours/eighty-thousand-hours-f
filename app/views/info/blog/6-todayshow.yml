  80,000 Hours founder Will Crouch appeared with Private Eye editor Ian Hislop
  on BBC Radio 4’s The Today Show. You can listen to the programme [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9645000/9645137.stm).
  
  The interview opens with Will explaining the logic behind 80,000 Hours’
  “Banker vs. Aid Worker” campaign: namely, that a professional philanthropist,
  or someone who enters a lucrative career with the intention of giving much of
  it away, can fund the work of several aid workers, and as such can do several
  times as much good.
  
  But interviewer John Humphrys had some bones to pick. These are some of the
  salient points he made.
  
  ##On that basis, we don’t need charity workers?
  
  Interviewer John Humphrys argued that, by this logic, we should all become
  bankers and no one should be a charity worker. This is a misunderstanding of
  80,000 Hours aims. We’re not the Banking Fan Club of Great Britain: we simply
  wish to help individuals make the biggest positive impact they can in their
  careers. As it stands, pursuing a lucrative career and funding several
  charity workers through it would do multiple times as good as being a charity
  worker yourself, but the lucrative career is a means to an end, not an end in
  and of itself.
  
  And we do assume a more-or-less constant pool of aid workers. Because as Will
  Crouch pointed out, persuasive as we may be, we’re not quite that persuasive:
  the NGO sector is extremely competitive, and there is little risk that 80K’s
  “Banker vs. Aid Worker” debate will suddenly create a labour shortage in the
  sector.
  
  ##But there’s a flaw: I know lots of people who want lucrative careers, but not many who want to give it all away
  
  As Will argued, that is precisely the purpose of 80,000 Hours. Lots of people
  have lucrative careers, and are sitting on funds which could do a tremendous
  amount of good, but very few are willing to give it to others. We are quite
  precisely trying to change that.
  
  The aim of the organization is to create a community or network of people
  with ethical aims and encourage them in their choice of career. We
  concentrate on young people, students and young professionals, to promote the
  mindset of using your life to make a positive difference in the world.  Given
  that they are living on a lot less than they will be when they go into their
  careers, it will be easier for them to give a significant portion of their
  income, rather undertaking the much more difficult task of scaling down your
  expenses once you are already used to a high-earning income.
  
  ##But is there not the danger that as people get older, they will lose these altruistic aims?
  
  Once again, that is the reason 80,000 Hours exists. We not only seek to
  promote an ethical approach to careers, we also aim to create a vibrant
  community of people with similar goals and ideals, who can mutually reinforce
  each other’s altruistic aims. As every one of us knows, it is hard to do the
  right thing when you’re on your own. But if you are surrounded by friends who
  have also made a similar commitment and are willing to go through the process
  of leading an ethical life together, the prospects of keeping true to your
  beliefs becomes a lot easier. 80,000 Hours seeks to put you in touch with
  other people pursuing similar goals, and together, as a community, we can
  stay committed to doing the most good we can through our careers.
  
  ##Taking another tack: try and make current big earners altruistic
  
  Private Eye Editor and Have I Got News For You panellist Ian Hislop aired the
  idea of taking a different approach: instead of trying to convince young
  people to become high earning philanthropists, he wondered if we could
  approach high earners and convince them to become philanthropists. Citing
  examples from his BBC programme “When Bankers Were Good”, he argued that
  bankers today have lost the ethical culture of their Victorian counterparts,
  when outsider figures such as Quaker or Jewish bankers worried about the
  ethical impact of their careers and commonly engaged in philanthropic
  pursuits. He contrasted this with the amoral, or immoral, banking culture of
  today, and argued that we should be trying to change the bankers of today,
  not merely of tomorrow.
  
  Will agreed, and pointed out that the 2008 financial crisis and much of the
  global recession was in part triggered by the greed of the financiers:
  perhaps, by encouraging those with ethical goals to enter into these careers,
  they might be able to do the job better than people largely motivated by
  greed, and benefit everyone in the process. In other words, a knock-on
  benefit of professional philanthropy is that by taking the job, you’ll
  probably be denying it to someone who would have done no good in it at all;
  because of your ethical motivations, you might do the job better, and avoid
  short-termism of the kind that engendered the financial crisis, for example.
  
  ##You can’t legislate people to become philanthropists, it must come from within
  
  Humphrys then turned to high-profile philanthropists of today, such as Bill
  Gates, and argued that such philanthropic tendencies cannot be imposed, but
  must arise naturally, from within.
  
  Ian Hislop retorted that, while it may be true we cannot demand that all
  bankers be altruistic, we can contribute to creating a culture of
  philanthropy, where instead of bankers telling the world “we make a lot of
  money, you should be grateful”, they can live by the maxim “we make a lot of
  money, *we* should be grateful.”
  
  It is a little mysterious how John Humphrys came to this idea. 80,000 Hours
  is not a legislative scheme. We are there precisely to help people develop
  their own ethical tendencies and then support them in their choice. We are
  not trying to demand that all bankers be ethical or coerce them into being so
  – we are trying to convince them to become ethical, and encourage some
  ethical people to become bankers (as long, of course, as they give a
  significant portion of their income to the best ethical causes).
