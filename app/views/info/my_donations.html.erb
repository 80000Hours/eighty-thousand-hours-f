A donation of £300 to the Stop TB Partnership is enough to prevent a death from tuberculosis. This is the figure we use to calculate how many lives you could save. It means that almost everyone living in a developed country has the power to save an incredible number of lives.
</p>

<p>
But there are health charities which are <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php#SCI">even more cost effective</a>. Charities which prevent debilitating tropical diseases can buy someone 30 years of healthy life for only £60. They also significantly improve school attendance and earning power.
