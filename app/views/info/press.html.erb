  <p>Eighty Thousand Hours is an organisation which supports and guides people who are pursuing careers which will allow them to do the most good in the world.

    <li>We think it might be better to become a banker than a charity worker, as a highly paid banker can pay for several charity workers.</li>

    <li>Based on research by Oxford University ethicist Will Crouch, </li>
