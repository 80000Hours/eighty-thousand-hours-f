###I declare that I aim to pursue a career as an effective altruist.

This means that I intend to:

1. Devote a significant proportion of my time or resources to helping others.
2. Use the time or resources I give as effectively as possible in helping others.
3. Make my career decisions based at least in part on how it enables me to further my altruistic aims.
