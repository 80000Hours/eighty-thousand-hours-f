      <%= org_name %> aims at encouraging people to pursue a career with a
      high ethical impact, and to give a portion of their time or money
      towards helping others. Providing extensive research on career choice
      and the best causes to fund, <%= org_name %> ensures its members think
      carefully about where and for whom their contribution can make the
      greatest difference.

      <p>
      I agree with these objectives and hereby express my support for the
      ideas that those, who are able to, pledge to give at least 10% of
      their working time or income to the causes shown to most benefit
      others, and that making the most difference is far more important than
      simply making a difference.‚Äù
