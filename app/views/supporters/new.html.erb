      <%= org_name %> aims at encouraging people to pursue a career with a high
      ethical impact, and to give a portion of their time or money towards
      helping others. Providing extensive research on career choice and the
      best causes to work towards, <%= org_name %> ensures its members think

      I agree with these objectives and hereby express my support for the ideas
      that those, who are able to, pledge to give at least 10% of their working
      time or income to the causes they believe on the basis of evidence to
      be among those that most help others. I support the idea of making
      the <span class="bold">most</span> difference.
