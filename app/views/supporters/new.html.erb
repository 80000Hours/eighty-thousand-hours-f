      80,000 Hours aims at encouraging people to pursue a career with a high ethical
      impact, using a significant portion of their time or resources towards helping
      others as effectively as possible. Providing extensive research on career
      choice and the best causes to work towards, 80,000 Hours ensures its members
      think carefully about where and for whom their contribution can make the
      greatest difference.

      <p>
      I agree with these objectives and hereby express my support for the 80,000
      Hours community.  I endorse the idea of thinking rationally about how one can
      make the most difference through one's career and support those who attempt to
      put this idea into practice in their own life.
