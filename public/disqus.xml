<message><![CDATA[<p>This is a valuable contribution to a debate which we should be having more often, about the real value of science. We need more democratic input into the purpose and design of research, and its potential benefits. It isn't always the obvious things - we might see (e.g.) mobile phones as toys but they can be life-enhancing for African farmers, finding out about commodity prices and so on. It is worth remembering that we now have the possibility for users of research to influence its application as well. Text messaging is an example of something which has essentially been developed by its users from a minor technological spin-off. And it was totally unforeseen by sci fi!</p>]]></message>

Working for an unethical company to fund philanthropy is at best a patchwork solution.</p><p>It is also bizzare that philanthropic organisations are not interested in the best human capital/passionate employees etc, but rather money to sustain their activities. At the same time, the possible unethical work of the contributor leads to further destruction and need for donations! </p><p>Worrying Example: <br>Person A works for an arms manufacturer. Person A Earns 100k. Pays 20k in taxes, government initiates illegal war (insert country here) paid for with public money. Person A doantes 30k on aid in the war torn country.

<message><![CDATA[<p>I haven't heard anybody else give that (or any other) specific figure, but there are several factors that seem to indicate that we should expect lower stock-market returns in the future. Siegel lists declining transaction costs, declining economic risk (ha!), investors' becoming aware of equities' superior returns, and low taxes as factors that justify a higher P/E (20-25) ratio. He thinks that this higher ratio has skewed historical returns upward.</p><p>There are other reasons to believe that future equity returns will be lower. As baby-boomers in the US and the aging populations of Europe and Japan begin to cash out their retirement savings, there will be downward pressure on stock valuations. And the smaller populations of workers in those countries may mean slower economic growth.</p><p>Tyler Cowen has made the case (in The Great Stagnation, which I haven't read) that productivity growth has slowed in the developed world as we've taken advantage of most of the easy gains to be had. The economic growth of the past century may have been a one-off opportunity. Globalization has made it easier for financial crises to spread. High levels of government debt may be a long-term problem.</p><p>On the other hand, the only argument that I've encountered for stock market returns to continue at their historical level is that, well, that's what they've done historically. But I haven't looked very far, I'm not an expert, and I'm sure there are arguments I've overlooked.</p><p>One way to (possibly) juice your returns would of course be to take on more risk (small caps or emerging markets).<br></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Overvaluation of equity relative to bonds in the past makes sense as a reason why future returns might be lower. Concerns about slower economic growth don't make sense to my probably-over-theoretical model of capital markets, because if people expect lower growth, then they should have *already* accounted for that by shifting away from stocks to other investments. As a result, stock prices should have fallen, and now, at the margin, stocks should once again be on par with other investments (in risk-adjusted returns). That said, I suppose expected returns for *everything* could be lower than before.</p><p>And in practice, markets can be less efficient than one might expect....</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Rowan. I need to update this piece with Givewell and GWWC's recommendations, so I'll have a look at GIANE when I do.</p><p>The problem with the types of cause you list is that (like so many others I'd love to know about), their value is very hard to quantify. That makes it very hard to know which organisation to go for, which means that in practice our choice is between giving to a near-random advocacy group or giving to the *best* health interventions.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That's a good point. It does tip the scales toward waiting, though you'll still want to consider the other factors of the calculation: The internal rates of return of your particular charity, your "rate of return on wisdom" during the coming years, your risk of becoming selfish later, the small chance of world economic collapse rendering your wealth useless, etc. Also, in the US, you can only deduct a total of up to 50% of your adjusted gross income, so you may not want to donate huge amounts to charity in a single year. On the other hand, if you do exceed 50%, you can "carry forward" missed deductions to future years, so it's not a huge problem either.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>On the content of the post, what it seems to show is that in an ideal world every do-gooder should go for entrepreneurship, and that they should create a welfare pool to offset risk aversity, from which failed/non-successful entrepreneurs could draw a salary equivalent to (say) their expected earnings in a salaried job.</p><p>That way if 10 people went into entrepreneurship, they'd still expect to contribute a larger amount than if any smaller fraction of them had gone into salaried jobs, without the disincentive of personal downfall. If the number was large enough it would be virtually a guarantee.</p><p>In practice I don't know how you'd ensure that everyone joining was sincere. You'd also need some sort of competence/motivation testing, so that people with no realistic chance of entrepreneurial success wouldn't join.</p><p>The absence of such a support structure 'til the present day suggests that the obstacles to it are larger than it feels like they should be.</p><p>Perhaps a practical alternative would be several such microstructures, where people got together in small enough numbers to avoid some of the bureaucracy/abuse that would inevitably come with a single group of do-gooders.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great post, Carl! Very compelling.</p><p>"so on average founding teams in this sample earned over $2 million per year, or a little over $1.4 million per year for each entrepreneur (some solo, some in teams)."<br>This is earnings per year during venture funding? How long, on average, did it take to get venture funding? What if we include those who never got venture funding? This might give a more accurate estimate of the time taken to earn those dollars. We might also make an adjustment for the longer working hours for startup founders.</p><p>The Hall and Woodward paper suggests there aren't excess expected returns from venture-capital investing the way there are from founding a company. The authors conclude by saying, "General partners are sufficiently diversified across companies that their earnings are not nearly as exposed to idiosyncratic risk as entrepreneurs. Investors receive risk-adjusted returns comparable to those available from the stock market and other investments." Phew! At least financial-economic theory isn't always wrong. :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I agree with Kristhof that banking has contributed immensely to modern society but the question relevant to people who are considering the social impact of going into banking is whether *at the margin* banking is helpful or harmful to society. Surely we continue to need some financial services but there are reasons to think that the finance sector is overblown and characterized by a zero-sum arms race which carries the negative externalities. So Kristhof's argument refarding finance seems poorly grounded. </p><p></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Agree with Ben Todd! In view of replaceability, the relevant consideration is how much more you'll contribute to the evilness (or goodness) of banking compared with the person who would have been hired in your place. Maybe because you were hired and the other person wasn't, you should expect yourself to be slightly better at accomplishing the goals of the banking system, but given the competition involved, that difference is tiny. However, the difference in your generosity compared with the next guy is huge -- not to mention the difference in your wisdom about where to extend that generosity (e.g., look at Romney's "charitable donations" to the Mormon Church).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>My problem with your approach is that it seems to involve question begging. When we maximise expected value given factual uncertainty, we've largely picked our ethical position already - subject to clarifying what we think 'value' is.</p><p>So to maximise the expected morality given various possible moral positions seems to be weighing them all on that same broadly consequentialist position. But if that position is right, then we can infer that any incompatible ethical view is wrong, so we don't need to compromise between them. And if it's wrong then a) we don't need to account for its dicta, and b) it can't give us a sensible guide to how to compromise between the other systems.</p><p>If, for the sake of simplicity, we do accept that distributing our confidence among the ethical systems philosophers offer us is the right approach, we still have a couple of dilemmas. </p><p>Firstly, how do we decide how much weight to put in each competing system? Do we give equal weight to each proposed system? (this would allow philosophers to 'cheat', by proposing several very similar systems and presenting them as multiple alternatives - and obviously doesn't give much consideration to the possibility of some systems being more convincing than others).</p><p>Or do we weight according to expert consensus? But expert consensus among philosophers is something it's hard to swallow. Expertise in a field usually entails knowing more of the implications of certain near-universally accepted principles than a layman (and perhaps of a greater set of further facts that are relevant to them). But what principles are widely enough accepted by (moral) philosophers to grant them such expert status?</p><p>Secondly, your examples don't seem to compare like for like. The sort of ethic which says that spending money on luxuries is bad normally treats its badness as quantifiable. It might be bad for me to only give £1 to charity, but it's worse for me to only give 50p, and better though bad still by Singer's view to give only £2.</p><p>The sort of ethic which calls abortion murder typically treats its badness as absolute. No matter who it saves, killing is a total wrong, so the negative value is infinite. </p><p>So how can you compare between them in any meaningful way, when granting *any* credence to the latter view would mean that having one abortion and giving some vast but finite sum of money to charity is still (infinitely) worse than giving no money at all but not having an abortion?</p><p>Needless to say, I think the inflexibility of the latter view is its proponents' problem...</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Luke,</p><p>Just a question about career choice to fight AI x-risk. You seem to suggest there's one main choice: if you're a strong mathematician or physicist then consider working in AI research, otherwise you can probably do more by earning money and donating it to AI research. Most people don't have the research option, so generally professional philanthropy is the best way to go.</p><p>But have you considered some of the other options? For instance, you could persuade people to donate to AI research. If you give up a high earning career, but persuade 2 people to take high earning careers and donate toAI research, then you've made more difference. That seems very easy, given how few people donate to AI research. So this seems better than pro phil. And there are probably other extremely effective things you could involving advocacy.</p><p>A slightly different option would be anything that improves the effectiveness of AI researchers. A great manager might be able to make 10 researchers 10% more effective, and thus do as much good as becoming one himself.</p><p>Thanks for the interview - really interesting.</p><p>Ben</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for writing this. My comments will all be critical in the spirit of efficient discussion but I appreciate your analysis and your taking the time to write this.&gt;&gt;&gt;‘It is not even a matter of some charities being 10 or 100 times as effective: even restricted to the field of health programs in developing countries, research shows that some are up to 10,000 times as effective as others.’ [1]This stands out to me as problematic. If one donates to a charity such as Oxfam which runs lots of programs then one's money is distributed over the programs. Even if only 1% of your money goes to the most effective health interventions then your donation is a hundredth as cost-effective as best possible health spending, not a ten thousandth as cost-effective as best possible health spending. &gt;&gt;&gt;This pledged total has since risen to $44 million dollars, an impressive figure for an organisation founded as recently as November 2009.One has to take into account the fact that those who pledged are much more likely to have donated and donated effectively than those who have not taken the pledge&gt;&gt;&gt; This is preferable to a tradition of donating privately and anonymously because when we perceive that others give, we all give more.This issue is less straightforward than it may seem. Yes, there are studies showing that people are more likely to give when the people in their social circles are giving. But it's equally true that people become resentful when others do things that make them feel morally inferior and this can create a negative halo around giving in their minds. &gt;&gt;&gt;These warrant further exploration. I will just make the general reminder that the greater your income, the less worthwhile it will be for you to volunteer and the more viable it will be to fund philanthropic influencing.On the other hand the greater one's income the more access one has to people of a similar socio-economic class so the more potential for influence one has. Consider for example the Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge which you mention. I would guess that the influence that Gates and Buffet had through promoting this pledge is lower than that of their own financial contributions. But the two things contributions may be in the same ballpark...&gt;&gt;&gt;Given these assumptions, to break even, you would have to gather 40 new professional donors in your lifetime. Here is the calculation:In line with my comment immediately above, the choice between focusing on donating and focusing on influencing is a false dichotomy; one can probably do better with a hybrid approach<br></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jonah, thanks. For anyone looking to write more on this topic, I think these are an ideal set of avenues for further investigation, exactly what I had in mind when I wrote the piece. As you said, in the spirit of efficiency, I'll just provide a few cautionary notes, covering your points in order:</p><p>1. The program / charity distinction is sensible. However, even if the average American or Australian is donating with 1% of the maximal effectiveness, this is a shame. And there are plenty of reasons to think our effectiveness is even worse than that. Think of the number of donations that do not go to development aid at all, but rather prop up first-world sport programs, art galleries,  schools, churches, etc.<br>2. This is true, although even if these people were already likely to donate, were they likely to do so effectively? If not, the impact of their charity may have been very small if not for GWWC.3. Yes, I completely agree, and a lot more needs to be written about this.<br>4. This is true. There is obviously a great difference between the Gates / Buffett cases, which I have not yet explored, and an ordinary Joe who volunteers for GWWC. There is some element of organisation philanthropy, e.g. the Giving Pledge. However, much of the work is done by secretaries and public relations people (funding organisational philanthropy). And there is a further element, as you suggest, of direct philanthropic influencing of wealthy friends, colleagues and acquaintances that arguable eludes my classification system.<br>5. But of course. The hybrid approach is the winner here. ("As an adjunct, philanthropic influencing will increase the influence of almost any professional donor"), and if only half of your work is done as a philanthropic influencer, then you only need to win over about 20 donors!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1.  I agree that missing out on a factor of 100x in efficacy is a shame, indeed, missing out on a factor of 2x is a shame. I wasn't so much quibbling over the precise number as much as to raise broader methodological issues. </p><p>You mention first-world charities (sports, art, school, churches). Though the median donation has low efficacy, some portion of these expenditures will be spectacularly cost-effective (e.g. in the days before the internet, a library stimulating the intellectual development of a researcher who will go on to develop a cure for a major disease). </p><p>I do think that one can make a strong case for the best developing world aid charities being much better than typical first-world charities. What I mean to allude to is that there's a strong "nothing is as good or as bad as it seems" quality to philanthropy due to a complicated web of indirect effects. This is partially addressed by Holden Karnofsky's blog post titled "Why We Can't Take Expected Value Estimates Literally (Even When They're Unbiased)" but deserves a fuller discussion.</p><p>5. Yes, I misunderstood this part of your post; thanks for clarifying. I think that there are synergistic effects between giving and more indirect influence.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p> In reply to your first point. It is true that giving to some charities gives you fairly little control over where the money actually goes. That's not a reason to give up, of course. It's just a reason to pick charities where you do have that kind of control (or charities whose best programmes are so good that they balance out the worse ones). I remember, I think, that Village Reach, for example, has some less and some more effective projects. But they also assess the project effectiveness pretty aggressively, so you can be confident that they'll try to improve on their bad performances and will reallocate money to more successful approaches.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Nice post, Carl. Another option is to pursue a job that allows one to direct large, existing budgets to cost-effective projects. These could include jobs at foundations, government agencies, and multilateral organizations, as well as some fundraising jobs. There are opportunities for relatively low-level managers to direct budgets &gt;$10M/yr, and to improve the cost-effectiveness of funded activities by at least a few orders of magnitude. The expected impact could be larger than that of most entrepreneur-donors. One has less freedom than donors in funding esoteric projects. But there are some existing foundations and private donors with esoteric interests, and the probability of influencing the ultra-wealthy may be higher than the probability of becoming ultra-wealthy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Love this Carl, great to see thought put in to career length - as I think our current advice, especially with respect to ibanking and consulting, fails to take much account of career length (see this: <br><a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2012/02/standard-model.html" rel="nofollow">http://epicureandealmaker.blog...</a> on banking).</p><p>That said though, it would be interesting to see what those who left careers as bankers and consultants went on to do. Consultancies make much of their exit options in their recruitment literature, and if McKinsey's exit record is anything like matched at other top 10/15 firms then I think it remains a very high career compensation path, even for those who don't stay in consulting itself. Similarly, both consultants and bankers often go on to private equity houses, which have the potential to be the fastest way to make money short of creating another facebook or running a successful multi-billion dollar hedge fund. This question of longer term earnings would be complicated by all those who leave intense City/Wall Street jobs and realise that they're not looking for money after all.</p><p>For those staying at consulting firms, I guess we'd want to look at career, rather than annual earnings, and career earnings would be affected significantly by the chances of making the partnership, the average tenure, the revenue per equity partner and all sorts of things.</p><p>Here's a useful UK consulting compensation report to match your US one (<a href="http://www.top-consultant.com/Top-Consultant_Salary_Report.pdf)" rel="nofollow">http://www.top-consultant.com/...</a></p><p></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, we've done some research on exit options, and they're quite nice, especially for those who stay in the business world. However, the more lucrative areas like successful hedge fund and private equity roles are scarcer, and the typical options like corporate finance and industrial management involve reduced compensation (with better lifestyle) relative to remaining on track. Certainly, elite MBAs who do investment banking make more than such MBAs in other fields.</p><p>The far right tail of finance comes from setting up one's own funds, mostly, (there are more self-made finance billionaires in the US than technology ones, generally through this route). This bumps up earnings significantly, but not radically. </p><p>My best impression now is that for consulting and finance the exit options are on average less lucrative, even controlling for people who go off to nonprofits or academia or government   Harvard. However, the exit options are still lucrative positions (better, often much better, than one would find as a non-entrepreneur engineer, say), and the stint in consulting or investment banking increases one's marketability for them via signaling/credentialism and networking (even after accounting for the selection bias that places like McKinsey and Goldman Sachs are more selective than most MBA employers).</p><p>There are ways of estimating whole-career earnings for these fields: we've looked at attrition rates, tax records (which include partnership figures and raw numbers), school alumni surveys, and firm filings and other records.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>"And non-human animals."<br>Well, sure.</p><p>The issue of optimising action is a big one. Here's one way to think about it, not necessarily one I agree with entirely. Optimising in this sort of case is a really tough problem. It's obviously just too hard to solve analytically. That means you should pay attention to, and can't not pay attention to, your underlying heuristics. Sometimes those heuristics are going to say things like "I don't want to do this"</p><p>When you run into a reaction that goes against your first level analysis you *could* make the assumption that your analysis must be right and go with it. Sometimes, that's true. Sometimes you have a lot of faith in your analysis. Sometimes you introspect and you find out your motivations for your 'heuristic' were just selfish and unworthy. But sometimes neither of those happens. After all, you know that your analysis isn't always right.</p><p>When you run into a situation where your heuristics are screaming "I don't want to do this", and your analysis is saying "I've worked it out, and I think it's probably good." it can actually be totally rational to run with the heuristics.</p><p>You're right, though, that sometimes this sort of thinking encourages us to pretend we're optimising when we're actually being selfish. In practice, I agree with you entirely. I generally like to say "This bit is for everyone else. This part of me will act in the best way for humanity. But this part is for me, and I don't care if I'm using it selfishly." I can't really justify that, except to say that I like it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>good question, I've been wondering about the same with my employer - they match donations 1:1 (up to a certain annual limit) and it always surprised me how even with such an incentive people do not donate more - if you add gift aid for high rate tax payers, high earning employees can raise a lot for charities even with small donations. Maybe people donate less as they think "I want to donate $200 so I only need to give $80 myself". would be interesting to hear what other people think.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>&gt;<br>So if we want to know how prepared to be for a nuclear war for instance, we should do something qualitative with scenarios and the like.</p><p>That's an interesting example to think about. Why does scenario planning feel more useful than estimating the probabilities of various scenarios happening?</p><p>Well, the information we have is immensely biased and noisy, so the probabilities just aren't very good. Secondly, and very importantly, the return on investment on getting better estimates is pretty low; "the risks are non-negligeable so we should do something about them because nuclear war is so horrid" is already enough to justify a lot of action; fine tuning the estimates seems to give little extra return. Thirdly, we might get too obsessed with the details of the numbers, and forget the uncertainty (even if we don't have that failing, our institutions might). Related to this is worry about "unknown unknowns": we have reason to suspect, based on based experience, that events in a nuclear war will turn out to be unpredictable in ways we can't expect now. So we should build up general resilience, rather than refining probability estimates over an incomplete set of possible outcomes.</p>]]></message>

However, some of us disagree about the sign of the value of colonization. :) Filling the Virgo Supercluster with computational power has the potential to create astronomical amounts of suffering (<a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?p=4454)" rel="nofollow">http://felicifia.org/viewtopic...</a>.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I agree with Brian that there is uncertainty about the "sign value of colonization". This is not only because of the potential of causing astronomical amounts of suffering, but also because--as Brian himself believes--suffering might matter much more than happiness does (so even a relatively small chance of an outcome with lots of suffering might make colonization a prospect with negative expected value).</p><p>Further on this, notice that the effects of a career on the probability of colonization might not constitute a dominant consideration compared to the effects of a career on the nature of colonization conditional on colonization actually occurring.  I used to think otherwise because I thought extinction risks were unevenly distributed and concentrated in the relative short-term future, over which we have greater causal control.  By contrast--I reasoned--, if we do succeed in colonizing the galaxy, most future sentients will be temporally very removed from us and hence outside the scope of deliberate benevolent intervention by present human agents.  However, I now see that this reasoning didn't consider the possibility of a single decision-making agency (a "singleton") determining the long-term fate of Earth-originating sentience.  As Robert Wiblin <a href="http://robertwiblin.com/2012/03/24/the-case-for-working-on-an-ai-singularity-even-if-it-is-highly-improbable/" rel="nofollow">notes</a> in a recent post, "In this world it is possible to influence what happens millions or billions of years from now, by influencing the kind of singleton which takes over and spreads acoss the universe."</p><p>The uncertainty surrounding the value of colonization could also have relevant effects on moral motivation.  Even if you think colonization will be astronomically good on the whole, believing that there is a non-negligible chance that it might be astronomically bad might make it hard for you to consciously seek to alter that event's probability in either direction.  Since there is no equivalent uncertainty surrounding the value of improving the welfare of future sentient beings, this might provide another reason for working on influencing the nature rather than the probability of colonization.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I appreciate the sentiment, and I agree with the overall point of this entry, but I find the tone a tad condescending (and perhaps even a little sexist?). About the philosophy PhD students - maybe its not that women don't want to go into a philosophy PhD, maybe they are discriminated against and just not admitted into universities, or maybe they are admitted and feel so discriminated against that they tend to quit more, etc. About the math - empirical studies suggest that women are as good in math as men, and they also seem to enjoy it as much, even if many women are discouraged from pursuing these interests as a profession out of gender prejudices. About frozen dinners - you seem to assume that women are the ones who feed the family (and this may be descriptively true, for the most part), but men can also cook, and the answer is dividing household chores, not frozen dinners. </p><p>I agree with your general observations about women's emotional education and think this kind of education (about caring for others' emotional wellbeing, for example) should be extended to men.Maybe women don't participate in the organizations you are mentioning because the men in them are not facilitating women to participate. Men tend to me enamoured with their own voices and tend to (mostly inadvertedly) quiet women's voices - and it is quite likely that men philosophers are particularly prone to this bad habit. Given that women are discriminated against in almost all spheres of life - and in academia this is obviously true (e.g. women earn about 75% the amount men earn) - I think that Giving  What We Can and 80,000 should be ACTIVELY trying to include women in their ranks (this is specially true for men in these organizations).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>80k is actively trying to include women. Our market research suggests that women are equally keen on the message as men, perhaps slightly more interested given that proportionally more women want ethical careers. I think the gender imbalance is the largely the result of us being founded by a group of men, and how we have promoted ourselves through some male heavy networks (LW and GWWC). I anticipate us evening out as we grow. </p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Doing research for the SIAI might be more interesting than my current job, and the pay wouldn't be much lower (though I wouldn't get vacation or holiday pay). But there's the replaceability issue.</p><p>If you think the SIAI is ineffective, you could channel the money you make to another organisation—but then the actual work you do for the SIAI has low intrinsic value. But if you think the SIAI is very effective, it would make sense to negotiate a lower (subsistence) wage so that you could avoid taxes (as opposed to earning more money and donating it back to the SIAI). Maybe this would be a good résumé-building option for people without jobs.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The replaceability issue is much less of a factor if the person you're replacing is also an EA. Not a given with SIAI, but far more likely than people you'd be replacing in most jobs. Plus Luke's note makes it sound like they're struggling to recruit people, which means you might not be replacing anyone, and if you are the difference between you might be larger than you expect.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I think De Grey's work is very important and that he has been a vital force in bringing the issue to the fore and in producing helpful conceptual tools for thinking about it. However I'm very skeptical about the parts where De Grey make substantive moral philosophical claims and arguments. They are often hasted, simplified and ignore relevant arguments in the philosophical literature. I wish De Grey would refrain from taking a stance on many of those issues and instead focused on the biological research.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Nice estimate. Another interesting point AdG made in the lecture: he reckoned that if you could demonstrate a bunch of rejuvenation techniques in mice (which, as it says, he reckons would take $50m p.a. for ~5 years), then big pharma would almost certainly jump in, since the potential financial rewards could be huge. So, the people who supply the first $250m have a chance of triggering many times that amount of money entering the field (if it works in mice).</p>]]></message>
